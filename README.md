# SQLAlchemy Hawaii Vacation  

Python and SQLAlchemy ORM queries with provided hawaii.s qlite were used to reflect tables into a new model and perform analysis of Hawaii climate. 

A Flask API app was used to create routes that retrieve JSON data such as precipitation values by date, stations, temperature observations from the last year, and min, max, and average temperatures within a specified date range.


The following analyses included:

1. SQLAlchemy was used to reflect existing databases to classes in Python
2. Queries were used to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data and plotting them over time using a pandas DataFrame
3. Queries were designed to obtain the total number of stations, the most active stations, and the last 12 months of temperature observation data (summarized as a histogram)
