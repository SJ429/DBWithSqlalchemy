# SQLAlchemy 
Wrote Python 3 scripts and utilized SQLAlchemy ORM queries for data exploration/analysis from a climate database. 

I have analyzed temperature and precipitation data from the area near Honolulu, Hawaii.
Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas and Matplotlib were used to do climate analysis and data exploration of the database

The following analyses were done:
Using queries to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data and plotting them over time using a pandas DataFrame
Designing queries to obtain the total number of stations, the most active stations, and the last 12 months of temperature observation data (summarized as a histogram)
Creating a Flask API app to create routes that retrieve JSON data such as precipitation values by date, stations, temperature observations from the last year, and min, max, and average temperatures within a specified date range.
